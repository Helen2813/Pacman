#How To Play Pac-Man
Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man. Avoid and kill the ghosts and eat all the pellets. There are 4 big pellets that Pac-Man can eat that allows the ghosts to be eaten. 
But be quick, because you only have a short amount of time, and with each level you clear, the less and less time you will get.
